# What Are Neural Networks?

- A Neural network, or Artificial Neural Network, is a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain to help recognize patterns

--

- The brain has about $1.5 \times 10^{10}$ neurons each with 10 to 104 connections called synapses. The speed of messages between neurons is about 100 m/sec which is much slower than CPU speed. 

--

- The human brain's fastest reaction time is around 100 ms. A neuron computation time is 1â€“10 ms. Computation (to no surprise) is 10 times faster! That is just for one simple task! 

--

- The original idea behind neural networks was to use a computer-based model of the human brain. We can recognize people in fractions of a second, but computers find this task diffucult. So why not make software more like the human brain?

--

- The brain model of connected neurons, first suggested by McCulloch and Pitts (1943)<sup>2</sup>, is too simplistic given more recent research

# What Are Neural Networks?

- As with artificial intelligence and the sentient takeover, the promise of NNs is not matched by the reality of their performance
